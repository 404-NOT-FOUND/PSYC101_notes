early childhood: identity development
--------------------------------------------------

kids get huge amt of social msgs
    - even now as adults

>>> social and emotional lives

proces: socialization
    - standards, values, knowledge of society
        - understand std. of my culture / society

personality formation
    - change of own UNIQUE pattern of feeling, thinking, and behaving

both influenced by...
    - parents
    - day care or school
    - social and economic circumstances
    - culture

>>> identity development

early childhood
    - kids struggle: initiative vs guilt
    - how declare autonomy as an individual within the social roles and moral standards of my society?
        - i.e. how to maintain self while making me look good

key to socialization is
    - identification of the self
        - desire to feel significant in a social environment
            - desire to be connected
                - to family, religion, neighborhood, nationality, sports team, etc.

two main identity formations during this time
    - sex-role identity
    - ethnic identity
        - start to see kids id themselves with the 2 identities.

>>> sex-role identity

age 2:
    - gender type expressed thru words

preschool:
    - different patterns of play and
    - different toy preferences

so how does this all emerge?  where do these gender roles come from?

>>> 5 theories of sex-role identity

see chart (where sex-role id comes from)

1) psychodynamic (Flued):
    - famous, but controversial
    - suggest both experience guilts

2) social learning:
    - reinforcement affects

3) cognitive developmental:
    - kids are active
    - based on progression of sex to understand
        - sex-role is stable (boys bcom men)
        - constancy (boy in girls clothes)

4) gender schema:
    - combines 2 & 3
        - observation & imitation
    - organize gender models

5) cultural:
    - sites gender stereotypes of gender
        - told to be a boy all the time

>>> ethnic identity

ethnic id is the subjective sense that you belong to some group
    - can even tell by grocery shop

presence of a ``white bias'' (Clark, 1950)
    - white kids prefer white dolls
    - why?
        - neg concept of own id?
        - opportunities?
        - white kids less challenges?

ethnic socialization by parents
    - emphasize ethnic heritage and pride
        - you should be proud of being ...
        - 88% homes do this
    - prepare kid for discrimination or prejudice
        - kids are aware
    - encourage mistrust of majority
        - ethnic mistrust
            - you should mistrust the majority race
            - 75% homes do
    - emphasize equality of all ethnicities
        - encourage love all people

>>> personal identity (personality)

self-evaluations start (ask a kid to describe self)
    - unrealistically pos about self
    - limitations of language
    - objective â€“ physical appearance, personal features, behaviors, abilities, preferences

how self-evaluations change
    - recount autobiographical memories independently
        - constant query
    - influence of sophisticated language

early childhood: self-regulation
--------------------------------------------------

how it starts...sleep, cry

as they get older...regulatory capacities expand
    - control attention
    - tune out distractions
    - put aside hurt feelings
    - keep secrets
        - have to understand the consequences of letting others know something

this process requires tremendous input and support from adults

thoughts and actions
    - direct own behavior, monitor own progress, modify problem solving, exercise effortful control
        - effortful control: inhibit self
    - internalization
        - when capable of self regulation without assistance of others
            - act independently

play
    - sociodramatic play link to self-regulation (play home)
        - bcuz of complex emotions, can role play
        - kids w/ less self-regulation should play this more

emotional control
    - understand own emotions, how their emotions affect others
    - manage own emotions, mask true feelings when necessary
    - execute display rules
